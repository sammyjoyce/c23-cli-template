## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our software seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this template or any project generated from it, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via one of the following methods:

1. **Email**: Send an email to security@yourorganization.com with:
   - Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
   - Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
   - The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
   - Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
   - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
   - Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
   - Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

2. **GitHub Security Advisories**: You can report a vulnerability privately through GitHub's Security Advisories feature:
   - Navigate to the Security tab of this repository
   - Click on "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the form with details about the vulnerability

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 7 days, we will provide an initial assessment of the vulnerability
- **Updates**: We will keep you informed about our progress towards a fix and full announcement
- **Credit**: We will credit you for the discovery when we announce the vulnerability (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Disclosure Policy

- We ask that you give us reasonable time to address the issue before making any public disclosure
- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly
- Once the issue is resolved, we will publish a security advisory detailing the vulnerability and crediting the discoverer
